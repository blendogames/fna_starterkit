# FNA Starter Kit

## About
This is a basic starter kit for the [FNA game framework](https://fna-xna.github.io).

Previous iterations of this code was used in parts of [Flotilla](https://blendogames.com/flotilla), [Atom Zombie Smasher](https://blendogames.com/atomzombiesmasher), [Air Forte](https://blendogames.com/airforte), [Planetfriend](https://lauramichet.itch.io/planetfriend), [Acre 6](https://blendogames.itch.io/acre6), [Tall Bagel](https://lauramichet.itch.io/tallbagel), and [Tall Bagel 2](https://lauramichet.itch.io/tallbagel2).

## What does it do?
This kit has simple implementations of:
- input management (keyboard/mouse/gamepad).
- rendering a 3D model.
- rendering a 2D sprite.
- rendering 2D text.
- playing sound effects.
- a manager for the stack of screens.
- game options (screen resolution, sound volume, etc).
- saving/loading a settings file.

## Usage
This kit is intended as a **starting point**, some very simple scaffolding to get you up and running quickly. I like the [FNA framework](https://fna-xna.github.io) a lot -- it's cleanly-written, thoughtfully-designed, flexible -- and I hope this helps give you a foothold in using it.

This is written in C# and a .sln solution for Visual Studio 2015 is provided.

Note: for the content pipeline, I wrote a tool that may be helpful: [XNB Watcher](https://blendogames.itch.io/blendo-xnb-watcher).
